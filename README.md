✨Hi, I'm pequeniaBestia, I live in Argentina. I'm not young anymore but I still want to learn how to program. 
After the essential step by html and css I focus now, little by little, in JS and I hope to share sometime something interesting with you. 
I admire the passion, intelligence, dedication and creativity of many of you.
